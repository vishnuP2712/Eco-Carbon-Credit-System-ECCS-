            <p>
              Carbon credits are calculated based on the carbon savings of your
              chosen transport method compared to driving alone in a gasoline
              car. Each transport method has a specific savings rate (in kg CO₂
              per km), which is multiplied by your commute distance.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, cycling saves approximately 0.192 kg of CO₂ per
              kilometer compared to driving. So a 5 km bicycle commute would
              earn you 0.96 carbon credits (0.192 × 5).

              Yes! Individual users can still track their sustainable commutes
              and accumulate carbon credits. These credits can be:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Maintained in your personal account until your employer joins
              </li>
              <li>Redeemed for personal rewards through our partner network</li>
              <li>Donated to environmental causes and projects</li>
              <li>Transferred to your employer's account once they register</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We encourage you to invite your employer to join our platform to
              maximize the impact of your sustainable commuting choices.
